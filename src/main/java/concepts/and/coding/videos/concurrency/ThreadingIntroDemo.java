    /*
    * Process -
        * is an instance of a program that is getting executed.
        * it has its own memory,thread etc. os allocate these resources to process when its created.
        * Compilation (javac Test.java) - generates bytecode that can be executed by JVM.
        * Execution(java Test) - now jvm starts the new process and run the main method of Test class.
        * while creating the process, "java MainClassName" command creates a new JVM instance. At the time of creating jvm instance
        * we can allocate and tell how much heap memory need to be allocated.
        * java -Xms256m -Xmx2g MainClassName
        * -Xms<size> - this sets the initial heap size,in the above case, it sets to 256MB.
        * -Xmx<size> - this allocates max heap size to 2GB, it jvm tries to access more RAM than 2GB - it will throw "OutOfMemoryError".
        *
    * Thread -
        * It is a lightweight process or smallest sequence of instructions that are executed by CPU independently.
        * One process can have multiple threads.
        * When process is created , it starts with a single thread aka main thread, from this thread, we can spawn multiple threads
        * It allows a program to perform the multiple task at the same time.
        * all threads share the same resources such as memory space but still can perform task independently.
        *
        * Benefits -
            *  Improved performance by task parallelism.
            *  Responsiveness
            *  Resource sharing
        * Challenges
            * Concurrency issue like Deadlock, data inconsistency etc.
            * Synchronized overhead.
            * Testing & Debugging is difficult.
            *
        * Thread LifeCycle
        *   New
        *       - Thread has been created but not started.
        *       - It is just an object in memory.
        *  Runnable -
        *      - Thread is ready to run.
        *      - Waiting for CPU time.
        * Running - when thread start executing its code.
        * Blocked - Different scenario where runnable thread goes into blocking state.
        *   - I/O - like reading from a file or database.
        *   - Lock acquired - if thread want to lock on a resource which is locked by other thread, it has to wait
        *  It Releases all the MONITOR LOCKS.
        * Waiting - Thread goes into this state
        *     - when we call the wait() method on this thread it goes to wait state,makes it non-runnable.
        *     - It goes back to runnable,once other thread calls notify() and notifyAll() method.
        *    It releases all the monitor locks.
        *
        * Timed waiting
        *   - Thread waits for specific period of time and comes back to runnable state,
        *   after specific condition met. like sleep(), join()
        * It does not release any monitor locks
        *
        * Terminated - life of thread is completed, can not be started back again.
        *
        *
        *
    * * JVM internals
    *   a. Code Segment
    *       - It contains the compiled BYTECODE(i.e, machine code) of the java program.
    *       - It is read only.
    *       - All threads within the same process, share the same code segment.
    *   b. Data segment
    *       - It contains the GLOBAL and STATIC variables.
    *       - All threads within the same process, share the same data segment.
    *       - Threads can read and modify the same data.
    *       - Synchronization is required between multiple threads.
    *   c. Heap
    *       - Objects created at runtime using "new" keyword are allocated in the heap.
    *       - It is shared among all threads of the same process(not to other process as they will have their own heap segment).
    *       - Threads can read and modify the heap data.
    *       - Synchronization is required between multiple threads.
    *   d. stack
    *       - Each thread has its own stack.
    *       - It manage method calls,local variables.
    *
    *   e. Register
    *       - When JIT(just in time) compiles converts the ByteCode into native machine code,
    *          it uses registers to optimize the generated machine code.
    *       - It helps in context switching.
    *       - Each thread hsa its own register.
    *
    *   f. Counter
    *       - It is also known as Program Counter - it points to the instruction which is getting executed.
    *       - It increments its counter after successfully execution of the instruction.
    *
    *
    *
    *   Part-2
    *   Thread creation ways
    *   1. Implementing 'Runnable' interface
    *   2. extending 'Thread' Class - It has init,run,sleep,start,stop,interrupt etc.
    *   note - internally Thread class implements Runnable interface - it has run method
    * */

        // we have 2 ways to create threads
        // as one class can implement multiple interfaces(multiple interfaces supported in java). - this is most preferred way of creating thread
        // one class can extend only 1 class - multiple inheritance not supported in java.

/*
   Re-entrant Locks can be acquired again by the same thread and the thread
   keeps a count of that.
   Then that thread has to unlock it same number of times.

   normally usually it is only once.

   unlock should be called in finally and code should be in try block.

   This also has a wait in form of Condition.await(). (which obviouly should be
   called inside a locked/synchronized block)

   This is basically helpful to avoid deadlocks which we will see in next
   program
